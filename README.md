### **Story Line**

#### Snaky the main character lost his job and got drunk. While driving, he was stopped by two cops but he escaped, but in the process, he lost part of his body and now he is just a head. Thanks to his super-power he can re-grow his limb after eating 1000 rats every 100 rats he re-grows 10% of his body. Since he is drunk Sneaky doesn't what he is eating so watch out for these rats. Move by using WASD or the Arrow Keys
