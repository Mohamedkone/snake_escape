                <p>You remember the old Snake game? This is not that.
                    This is a re-imagined version. Snaky the main character lost his
                    job and got drunk. While driving, he was stopped by two cops but he escaped , but in the process,
                    he lost part of his body and now he is just a head. Thanks to his
                    super-power he can re-grow his limb after eating 1000 rats every
                    100 rats he re-grows 10% of his body. Since he is drunk Sneaky doesn't
                    what he is eating so watch out for these rats. Move by using WASD or the Arrow Keys
